# My First React App: a temperature control app

I followed this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-beginner-project-tutorial-temperature-control-app/) for this project. 
## My First Project on GitHub & GitHub Pages

I did this project from zero to deployment. yey!

React hooks were used in this project. This is really a mini project haha.

And I learned how to use GitHub in VSCode, as well as deploy react apps to GitHub Pages in CLI.

Check out the deployment [here](https://wnchng.github.io/temperature-control/).
